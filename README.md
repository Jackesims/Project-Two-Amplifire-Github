### Instructions for Using the Tool

As previously stated, data is collected in the form of CSV files from https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/mortality.

Download the individual CSV files by year, and upload each CSV file to /home/maria_dev. Then, add the file name to a separate CSV file called "csvFileList.csv", and add a return ("\n") at the end. This serves as the delimiter. Upload this specific file to /home/maria_dev.
